\description{
This function performs Bayesian variable selection and effect fusion for
categorical predictors in a linear regression model. Effect fusion aims at the question which
categories of an ordinal or nominal predictor have a similar effect on the response and therefore
can be fused to obtain a sparser representation of the model. Effect fusion and variable selection
can be obtained either with a prior that has an interpretation as spike and slab prior on the
level effect differences or with a sparse finite mixture prior on the level effects. The
regression coefficients are estimated with a flat uninformative prior after model selection or
model averaged. For posterior inference, an MCMC sampling scheme is used that involves only
Gibbs sampling steps.
}
\details{
This function provides identification of categories (of ordinal and nominal predictors) with the
same effect on the response and automatic fusion.

Two different prior versions for effect fusion and variable selection are available. The first prior version
allows a priori for almost perfect as well as almost zero dependence between level effects. This prior has also
an interpretation as independent spike and slab prior on all pairwise differences of level effects and correction
for the linear dependence of the effect differences. Even though the prior is mainly designed for fusion of level
effects, excluding some categories from the model as well as the whole covariate (variable selection) can also be easily accomplished.
Excluding a category from the model corresponds to fusion of this category to the baseline and excluding the whole
covariate consequently to fusion of all categories to the baseline.

The second prior is a modification of the usual spike and slab prior for the regression coefficients by combining
the spike at zero with a finite location mixture of normal components. It enables detection of categories with similar
effects on the response by clustering the regression effects. Categories with effects that are allocated to the same
cluster are fused. Due to the specification with one component located at zero also automatic exclusion of
categories without effect on the outcome is provided.

In settings with large numbers of categories, we recommend to use the sparse finite mixture prior. The
sparse finite mixture prior on the level effects does not take into account the ordering information of ordinal
predictors and treats them like nominal predictors.

Metric predictors can be included in the model as well and variable selection with spike and slab
prior will be performed for these predictors.

Details for the model specification (see arguments):
\describe{
 \item{\code{mcmc}}{A list:}
 {\describe{
   \item{\code{M}}{number of MCMC iterations after the burn-in phase; defaults to 8000.}
   \item{\code{burnin}}{number of MCMC iterations discarded as burn-in; defaults to 2000.}
   \item{\code{startsel}}{number of MCMC iterations drawn from the model without performing variable selection;
   defaults to 1000.}
 }}
 \item{\code{prior}}{\describe{\item{}{A list (depending on used \code{method}):}
   \item{\code{r}}{variance ratio of slab to spike component; default to 50000. \code{r} has almost no influence on
   model selection for ordinal predictors but for nominal covariates low values of \code{r} encourage strong
   fusion. \code{r} should be chosen not too samll but still small enought to avoid stickiness of MCMC. We
   recommend a value of at least 20000.}
   \item{\code{g0}}{shape parameter of inverse gamma distribution when \code{method='SS'}; default
   to 5. The default value is a standard choice in variable selection where the tails of spike and slab are not too thin
   to cause mixing problems in MCMC.}
   \item{\code{G0}}{scale parameter of inverse gamma distribution when \code{method='SS'}; default
   to 25. \code{G0} controlls to some extend the sparsity of the model. Smaller values for \code{G0} help to detect also small
   level effect differences of nominal predictors, but result in less fusion of categories for ordinal predictors.}
   \item{\code{tau2_fix}}{fix value of slab variance when \code{method='SS'} and if no hyper-prior should be used;
   default to \code{NULL}. Similar to the scale parameter of its hyper-prior \code{G0}, the fixed variance of the slab
   component \code{tau2_fix} can control to some extend the sparsity. Samller values help to detect also small
   level effect differences but may result in less fusion of categories for ordinal predictors.}
   \item{\code{s0}}{hyper-parameter (shape) of inverse gamma distribution on error variance, used for both
   versions of \code{method}; default to 0.}
   \item{\code{S0}}{hyper-parameter (scale) of inverse gamma distribution on error variance, used for both
   versions of \code{method}; default to 0.}
   \item{\code{e0}}{parameter of Dirichlet hyper-prior on mixture weights when \code{method='FM'};
   default to 0.01. Due to asymptotic convergence \code{e0} should be chosen smaller than 1. Small values such as
   0.01 help to concentrate the model space on sparse solutions.}
   \item{\code{p}}{prior parameter to control mixture component variances when \code{method='FM'}; default
   to 1000. When \code{hyperprior=FALSE}, larger values of \code{p} lead to less sparsity and it should be chosen
   not smaller than 100. If a hyper-prior on the mixture component variances is used (\code{hyperprior=TRUE}), \code{p}
   has almost no effect on the sparsity of the model and it should again be not smaller than 100.}
   \item{\code{hyperprior}}{logical value if inverse gamma hyper-prior on component variance when \code{method='FM'}
   should be used; default to FALSE. The hyper-prior leads to robust results concerning the specification of \code{p}
   but also to very sparse solutions.}

\note{
The function can be used for ordinal and/or nominal predictors and metric covariates
can additionally be included in the model. Binary covariates as a special case of nominal predictors
can be included as well.

The sparse finite mixture prior approach does not take into account the ordering information of ordinal
predictors. Ordinal predictors are treated as nominal predictors.

For large models and more than 15,000 MCMC iterations, some thinning of the MCMC when using the sparse finite
mixture prior is performed due to computational issues.
