\description{
Returns basic information about the model and the priors, MCMC details and posterior
means from the refit of the selected model or model averaged results as well as 95\%-HPD intervals for the regression effects.
}
\details{
The model selected with function \code{effectFusion} is refitted with a flat uninformative 
prior to get estimates for the regression coefficients \code{beta}. The posterior means and 95\%-HPD 
intervals resulting from this refit are shown with this function. Fused categories have the same 
regression coefficient estimates and the same HPD intervals. 

If a full model is fitted (\code{method} in \code{effectFusion} is NULL) or no final model selection is performed 
(argument \code{modelSelection} in \code{effectFusion} is NULL), the coefficient estimates are model
averaged results.
