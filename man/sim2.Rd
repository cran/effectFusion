\description{
The simulated data set \code{sim2} illustrates a setting with 4000 observations from a linear 
regression model. The model has four independent predictors with either 10 or 100 categories and 
uniform prior class probabilities. The first covariate with 10 categories has three levels with no 
effects, three levels with effects of size 0.5 and the remaining three levels have effects of size one. 
The second covariate with 10 categories has 8 levels with no effects and only one level with an effect 
of size one. The final covariate with 10 categories has only levels without any effect on the 
outcome. Analogue to the first one, the covariate with 100 categories has 33 levels with 
no effects, 33 levels with effects of size 0.5 and 33 levels with effects of size 1.
