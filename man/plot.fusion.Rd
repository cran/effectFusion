\title{Plot an object of class \code{fusion}}
\usage{
\method{plot}{fusion}(x, maxPlots = 4, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{fusion}}

\item{maxPlots}{maximum number of plots on a single page, default argument to 4}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods (not used)}
}
\description{
This function provides plots of posterior means and 95\%-HPD intervals for the
regression effects after model selection. Plots are based on the refitted MCMC samples of the
selected model in an object of class \code{fusion}.
}
\details{
If model selection is not performed, posterior means and HPD itervals are model averaged
results. Otherwise model selection is performed and the parameters of the selected model are estimate
with a flat uninformative prior.
Fused categories have the same posterior mean and HPD interval. Single categories that are excluded
from the model are fused to the reference category and therefore only a posterior mean at zero and no
interval is plotted.
